# ðŸ”¢ MNIST Digit Classification using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook implementing a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The MLP is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on 60,000 labeled digit images.

## ðŸ§  What is MNIST?

- **MNIST** (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a classic dataset of **28x28 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (0â€“9).
- It is widely used for benchmarking image classification models.
